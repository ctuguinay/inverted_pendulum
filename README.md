# Inverted Pendulum - Control Systems

I am writing a simple to understand series on controlling real physical systems.
You may access it [here](https://kusemanohar.wordpress.com/tag/control-systems/).

### Inverted Pendulum only System
```
python free_fall_pendulum.py
```

### Inverted Pendulum and Cart System
```
python free_fall_cart_and_pendulum.py
```

### Forced Inverted Pendulum and Cart System
In this example, the motors on the cart are actuated at fixed time.
Thus, they deliver an external force on the system at pre-determined time.
